                                 and Protectorate","In the first decades of colonial rule, British imperial administrators abolished slavery
 in Zanzibar, but their attempts to persuade Arab landowners to embrace wage labor
 in the place of slave labor fell on deaf ears. The once-powerful Arab clove planters
 had lost much of their political influence over the course of the 19th century, and
 many were heavily in debt to Indian moneylenders. The development of this situation
 is vital to understanding how colonial policies were implemented and how Zanzibaris
 navigated the changes which occurred in the early colonial period. This thesis analyzes
 the current state of scholarship on Zanzibar's early colonial history, and argues
 that there has been a tendency for studies to rely too heavily on casting 1890 as
 a turning point, which has the effect of downplaying continuities between pre-colonial
 and early colonial processes of economic, political, and social change. I advocate
 for a rethinking of temporal boundaries in future research on this subject, and I
 examine two processes, the slave trade and the British exploitation of Indian merchants,
 which demonstrate the theoretical benefits that can be derived from crossing the imagined
 border between the pre-colonial and colonial eras.",2014

 position of the press in practice. The first two chapters piece together a history
 of journalism in the country alongside a theoretical discussion of the role and responsibilities
 of the press in society. This is followed by an examination of the UAE's canon of
 media law and a news analysis of national newspapers. Despite a push to foster journalism
 in the country, the legal framework has not yet caught up with the purported vision
 of the press. This dichotomy of informal promises on the one hand and the formal legal
 canon on the other is one of the biggest challenges the press currently faces in the
 UAE. This creates uncertainty in the newsroom, ultimately leading to an inclination
 towards self-censorship when reporting sensitive issues because of a fear of crossing
 the 'red line' of journalism.",2016

 economic, and social forces have influenced the negative portrayals we see in American

 due to a number of structural implementation challenges, including policy decontextualization
 and a competitive development architecture. In terms of the empowerment of Syrian
 refugees, however, the failure of the Jordan Compact was not so much a question of
 flawed implementation as it was of the ""anti-politics"" of development-based refugee
 policy. Syrians in Jordan do not just suffer from ""underdevelopment,"" but also from
 a weak protection regime that circumvents the question of durable solutions and facilitates
 exploitation, discrimination, and abuse. In this way, a critique of the Jordan Compact
 should first and foremost highlight the political failure of the compact to strengthen
 refugee protection and offer a durable, long-term solution to the refugee crisis.",2019

 I examine the museum's reconciliation of local and universal heritage, the UAE nation-building

 projects. I argue that Louvre Abu Dhabi brand becomes regionalized and appropriated
 for the UAE nation-branding and regional diplomacy. At the same time, I demonstrate
 that Emiratis, despite appreciation of the universal narrative, view the museum primarily
 as a branding project and a tourist-oriented establishment, disapproving of its emphasis
 on the Western culture and insufficient reach out to the local population. Hence,
 Emiratis desire bigger representation of the local heritage at Louvre, seeing it as
 worthy of being part of the universal narrative. In addition, I argue that Louvre
 Abu Dhabi, apart from mitigating the nation-building and branding contradictions,
 gives a way for a young educated upper- and middle-class Emiratis to practice and
 express their elitist cultural identity in contradistinction to the older, less educated,

 to the existing literature on the topic, but also coming together as a whole. The
 first chapter is a historical account of LGBT+-activism in Tunisia, identifying important
 periods and ruptures. The second chapter is a contemporary mapping of the Tunisian
 LGBT+-activist community, focused on organizations' differences, interplay and conflicts.
 The third chapter argues that Tunisian LGBT+-activists are doing a good job at navigating
 complex political structures to their benefit and also details the concrete work being
 carried out. The final chapter argues that if Tunisian LGBT+-activists continue to
 self-evaluate and improve their ability to assert influence, they have a unique chance
 to become brokers of broad political alliances over progressive social policies. This
 is in part due to the fact that LGBT+-rights are not a politically polarizing issue
 and in part because the organizations are not tainted by affiliations with the Ben

 highly centralized story, where political interests and sub-national considerations
 play little or no significant role. This narrative has traditionally depicted Emirati
 foreign policy formation as being the sole creation of the capital and wealthiest

 investigation into the history and current dynamics surrounding UAE foreign policy
 formation, this capstone highlights the numerous considerations that affect Emirati
 foreign policy. It does this by examining three cases: Emirati policy towards Islamism,
 towards Iran, and Emirati foreign economic policy. Under Sheikh Zayed al-Nahyan, each
 emirate had limited freedom to formulate foreign policy concerning other states. Since
 Sheikh Zayed's passing, his son and the de-facto leader of the UAE, Sheikh Mohamed
 bin Zayed al-Nahyan, has worked to centralize the federal government under himself.

 in order to find their reward and successfully complete the game. Although each team
 is in their own room and may believe they are the only ones taking part on the experience,
 eventually they unlock a video feed that connects them to the parallel room and the
 second team. Wings of Resistance is not only a test of wit, bit also of trust and
 cooperation. Some puzzles in the rooms require the exchange of information between
 teams, leading to the final reward. Before the final puzzle, the teams are presented
 with Prisoner's Dilemma-like scenario: finish the game alone at the cost of the other
 team, or trust them and cooperate. However, this is also a test, as betrayal leads
 to instant disqualification - the only way to succeed is through cooperation. Successful

 character has long since exceeded one hundred. This thesis questions the difference
 of seeing reproductions of his paintings on screen rather than the originals in museums

 allows a wider audience to see his paintings in places where his paintings have not
 been previously exhibited. While translating painted images to the filmic medium cannot
 reproduce the experience of seeing the originals, van Gogh continues to entice filmmakers
 from different generations to render different stories about van Gogh and his art
 on screen. By examining the first major Hollywood film on the artist, Lust for Life
 (1956), and later Vincent and Theo (1990), and the first fully painted animated film

 to shed new light on the van Gogh myth and his artwork by using film as a means for

 personal relationships between British representatives and the local Gulf rulers.
 From 1947, the tone of those relationships changed substantially, from authoritarian
 to more collaborative. Recent scholarship suggests that this change was due to a diversification
 of the educational backgrounds of the British representatives: prior to 1947, all
 of them had attended public schools, which imbued them with highly imperialistic attitudes.
 However, after 1947, their education was more diverse, and no longer propagated such
 an imperial ideology; thus, the British representatives were no longer as authoritarian.This thesis offers a more nuanced version of this argument, by taking into account
 the prevailing attitudes towards Empire in Britain, as well as pressures on Britain's
 position in the Gulf from powers in the region. Ultimately, I argue, educational background
 merely contributed to the change in the relationship; more significant were regional
 pressures that forced the British representatives to effect policy that necessitated
 greater collaboration with the local rulers, and thus a change in the nature of the
 relationship.",2014

 that the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Mediterranean ceased to exist as a frontier
 of fruitful cross-religious contact between Christian Europeans and Muslim North Africans.
 This thesis supports that position by showing that amidst violence, specific types
 of middlemen, including corsairs, captives, slaves, and diplomats, continued to live
 in connection with both Christian Europe and Muslim North Africa. I argue for an understanding
 of religious violence that accepts its tragic and harmful consequences while acknowledging
 it as an avenue through which cross-cultural and religious knowledge was facilitated.
 Within this framework, I explore the physical violence of piracy and captivity as
 well as the concept of structural violence in connection with the career of the Jewish
 merchant and diplomat Samuel Pallache. Finally, I turn to consider an anti-Christian
 polemical work that has received limited scholarly attention: Ahmad ibn Qasim al-Hajari's
 Kitab nasir al din 'ala 'l-qawm al-kafirin (The Supporter of Religion Against the
 Infidel). The violent language in Kitab nasir al-din was the only way in which al-Hajari
 could convey stories of his respect and admiration for Christians to his Muslim North
 African audience.",2014

 doctors: Churchill: The Struggle for Survival 1940-1965 (1966) by Charles Wilson (known
 by his honourary title of Lord Moran), and The Private Life of Chairman Mao (1994)

 of Winston Churchill and Mao Zedong respectively, forming extremely close relationships
 in the process.All biography written by personal associates raises the question of how such relationships
 affect not only the content of the work, but also its reception. However, research
 regarding this question is surprisingly thin, and in turn the question remains largely
 unanswered. This thesis, by comparing biographical traditions in both England and
 China, and by examining biographies of Winston Churchill and Mao Zedong, offers specific
 answers to this question. I argue that a comparative analysis, mindful of the distinctive
 features of Chinese and English biographical traditions, reveals that the politics
 of intimacy in historical biography is greatly shaped not only by historical context,

 one example of exclusionary practices used in Australian history to define in and
 out groups in Australian society. This example often disappears from dominant narratives
 of Australian military and social history, or internees' experiences are written about
 in isolated categories of nationalities. This study examines internees' own stories
 from the Tatura and Loveday internment camps in conjunction with official histories
 and different trends in writing Australian history. In addition, this study looks
 at ways internees were forced to confront their own identities through internment
 and how on exit from the camps, internees were pressured to adopt attitudes in line
 with Anglo-Australia and internalised their internment experience. Finally, this study
 shows that recent trends in Australian history have focused on finding space for non-white
 others and that internment camps need to be incorporated in these histories to understand
 the forces that have constructed white Australian identities and subsequent politics.",2015

 of Belgian King Leopold II sparked international outcry. Reformist literature surrounding
 the London-based Congo Reform Association (CRA) criticized the King and his colony
 by inverting imperial discourse, identifying Leopold's State with excess, savagery,
 and madness. Through this mode of critique, CRA writers perpetuated an imperialist
 ideology based on a masculine ideal of the colonizer. In reworking these accusations
 of madness, modern literary and historical adaptations of the history of the State
 and the CRA repeat an ultimately unproductive discourse of violence, rooted in ideals
 of imperial masculinity. This paper examines the gendered nature of this discourse,
 and attempts to move away from hegemonic representations of violence through historical-literary
 analysis of three distinct moments. The paper tracks the trope of madness through
 the interweaving stories of the CRA, the trial and execution of British consul Roger
 Casement, and Jean Boenga's account of a colonial officer's suicide, and reads these
 moments for alternative representations of violence.",2016

 trade continued to connect Tibet and China across formidable mountains even as state

 the relationship between tea trade and state building in the Sino-Tibetan borderlands
 as China struggled to create a modern nation from the ruins of an empire. Drawing
 on both archival and published sources, the author uncovers the divergent paths taken
 by two Chinese provinces – Sichuan and Yunnan – as they continued to supply tea to
 Tibet amidst ongoing border conflicts after the Qing Empire collapsed in 1911. Imperial
 legacies of taxation, complex frontier politics, and the successful integration of
 the Sino-Southeast Asian trade networks into the Sino-Tibetan tea trade all contributed

 designed to assimilate the Aboriginal population, official publications promoting
 this administrative strategy, as well as internal classification schemes used by the

 Grass-roots activists associated with the Aboriginal-Australian Fellowship sought
 to create a distinct Aboriginal identity that could be integrated within a multi-ethnic
 Australian nation. Their compromise position would be challenged as Aboriginal people
 began to demand land rights, challenging the sovereignty of the Australian state.
 Debates over the place of Aboriginality in Australian society were played out at the
 local level as Aboriginal activists sought to claim a space within the city of Sydney,
 against opposition from other residents and government agencies. Exploring Aboriginality
 in an urban context in this period reveals how local governments, community organisations
 and Aboriginal leaders laid claim to their own understandings of Aboriginality. In

 Mu Gong identified and facilitated different forms of relationship between himself
 and the neighboring powers in cultural, political, and military aspects; during this
 process, the Ming Chinese state played an important yet only partial role. For example,
 he was a committed follower of Chinese literary culture, an independent politician

 sovereignty, the gradual loss of French influence over European affairs and complex
 relations with Germany and the United States. The project demonstrates that France's

 in three contemporary Canadian novels: Don LePan's Animals, 2009; Yann Martel's Life
 of Pi, 2001; and Margaret Atwood's The Year of the Flood, 2009. I argue that each
 novel contains a specific anxiety over whether—and under what conditions—eating meat
 is ethically justifiable, and that in each case this anxiety stems from questions
 about how humans draw distinctions between their own species and nonhuman animals.
 Each novel also demonstrates an awareness that these boundaries, both between humans
 and nonhumans and between different species of animals, are often arbitrary and subject
 to change. Fundamental human ambivalences in how to relate to different species of
 animals lead to the physical ambiguity of meat; acknowledging these ambivalences results
 in a ""cannibal anxiety"", or anxiety over whether eating nonhuman flesh is any different
 than eating human flesh. I will examine how these novels reveal or suggest ways of
 dealing with these ambiguities and their resultant anxieties, and how they challenge
 the reader to rethink both their meat-eating practices and their wider relationships

 Un Prophète (2009) and Mohamed Hamidi's Né Quelque Part (2013) navigate between Frenchness,
 Arabness, and Muslimness in ways that render their complex identities institutionally
 irreconcilable. Throughout the films' narratives, they encounter changing conceptions
 of their overlapping identities in the context of their movements through spaces via
 temporal and metaphorical journeys within (and without) the French Republic.Borrowing Will Higbee's notion of 'post-beur' cinema, I argue that these films resist
 being read through the realist, sociological, and postcolonial lenses that differentiate,
 if not the films themselves, then the analyses that they invite, from the ""beur"" generation.
 They mark a departure towards a transvergent cinema that deconstructs notions of center
 and margins, incorporating Deleuze's rhizome towards a reading of how the features

 work of Galsan Tschinag, however, a Tuvan Mongolian shaman and author of thirty books
 in German, provokes a radical re-imagination of the contours of German literary and
 linguistic history. His fictionalized autobiography Die Rückkehr: Roman meines Lebens

 invokes Mongol, Soviet, Tuvan, and European literary forms to weave together Central
 Asian and European histories. I read Die Rückkehr in conversation with Deleuze and
 Guattari's Toward a Minor Literature, whose emphasis on language as a deterritorialized,
 dynamic space of imagination, rather than an entity circumscribed by national boundaries,
 allows me to analyze Tschinag's work within the broader contexts of German and Mongolian
 literatures, and of minor literatures in general. The text's formal experimentation
 and staging of autobiographical truth through fiction allow the author to comment
 on both post-socialist Mongolia and contemporary Germany. By revealing the various
 traditions that converge in his work, I argue for a more integrated understanding

 allowing him to rewrite history and tradition. Borges uses translation to reshape
 his literary heritage, as well as his own national history. This practice is exemplified
 by his 1925 translation of the last page of James Joyce's Ulysses in the publication
 Proa, which recreates Ulysses in Buenos Aires and, when published, challenged conceptions
 of what Argentine literature should look like. His Antología de la literatura fantástica
 ('Anthology of Fantastic Literature'), which includes other translated portions of
 Ulysses, upsets traditional understandings of the canon, periods of literary history,
 and traditional practices of translation. My project explores Borges's unconventional
 understanding of chronology to consider how his literary texts unsettle orthodox understandings
 of world literature, as well as of Argentine history and literary tradition. An alternative
 conception of world literature based on a non-linear sense of time elucidates Borges's
 own works, as well as Joyce's Ulysses, and suggests how current dominant models of

 various literary references becoming a performative exercise in striking the balance
 between disparate influences and cultures that a postcolonial novel comes out of.
 Gérard Genette's classification of transtextuality has been useful in understanding
 how different modes of intertextuality can work within the same space. Aamir Mufti's
 conception of World Literature highlights the cultural dynamics that underlie such
 references. Thinking with both highlights the need to re-evaluate how intertextuality
 fits within these new literary contexts. Season of Migration to the North seems to

 connection between the conservatism of sports manga's gender politics and its popularity.
 This conservatism is the lingering legacy of Japan's encounters with Western attitudes

 into Japanese cultural norms. Examples included deference to hierarchy and images
 of masculine strength. The prevalence of such norms, as evidenced by its representation

 counting is a method by which pregnant women quantify the movements they feels to
 assess the condition of their baby. While fetal kick can vary on daily bases, a significant
 deviation from the normally expected value, which is 10 kicks in 2 hours, indicates
 that the woman should consult her medical provider. While fetal movement can be observed
 using ultrasound imaging, a non-invasive and home based monitoring system is still

 absorption refrigeration cycle that uses solar energy as the sole source of energy.
 Design goals were focused on low toxicity, sustainability, reliability and therefore,
 applicability to urban environments. Conventional vapor compression cycles use electricity
 and emit gases that cause air pollution and therefore, there is a strong imperative
 to create an alternative.
 The main drawbacks of the current absorption refrigeration systems, which use ammonia
 or lithium bromide working fluids, are:
 1. Ammonia is highly toxic, flammable and explosive. 2. Lithium bromide is expensive
 and has the issue of crystallization at a range of temperatures, pressures and concentrations.
 Thus, in this capstone project, ethylene glycol was used as an absorption medium for
 the working fluid (water). Specifically, the design process included:
 1. Optimization of the size of the absorber to get a coefficient of performance (COP)
 higher than 0.67. 2. Decreasing the heat loss from the desorber to increase the
 COP. 
 3. Preventing leakages when the cycle runs in a vacuum (pressure range from 1.5 kPa
 to 30 kPa) by using better-designed instruments. 4. Comprehensive data acquisition
 methods to get data from each component in the cycle.

 by modality-specific or amodal representations by expanding the work reported by Kim
 et al. (2004). Visual speech was used to prime auditory and written targets across
 four conditions: repetition, non-repetition, same-onset, and same-rhyme. Lexical decision
 task (word vs. pseudoword) reaction times were used to assess the degree of priming.
 Selective repetition priming for both auditory and written LDT's was predicted. Results
 demonstrated facilitatory priming of repetition, same-onset, and same-rhyme conditions
 compared to control for both words and pseudowords in the auditory LDT. In the written
 LDT, repetition and same-onset priming was found to facilitate processing of words
 while repetition priming inhibited priming of pseudowords. Together, these results
 suggest that silent visual articulations do influence language perception, which is
 consistent with an amodal model of language perception dependent on an underlying
 motor bases. It remains unclear whether visual speech simply activates phonological
 units without lexical-specificity, as suggested by results of the auditory LDT, or
 whether it activates words in the mental lexicon, as suggested by results of the written

                                 Drosophila Larval Brain","Major: BiologyAbstract: Zelda (Zld) is a transcription factor that is thought to coordinate the
 neuroepithelial (NE) stem cell network in the Drosophila larval brain. NE cells undergo
 differentiation to become neuroblasts (NB), which divide asymmetrically to maintain
 the correct balance of stem cells vs. differentiated cells. The NE-to-NB transition
 is controlled through the interaction of the EGFR and Notch signaling pathways. zld
 is expressed in NE cells of larval brains, and NE cells lacking Zld show early transformation
 into NBs. As such, we hypothesize that Zld is a possible regulator of the NE fate
 and thus integral to these pathways. The expression patterns of the Bearded (Brd),
 Ocho and escargot (esg) genes were assayed in wildtype and zld mutants as they are
 known to be expressed in NE cells. Zld was found to regulate the expression of Brd
 and esg, but not Ocho, suggesting that Zld only regulates certain genes involved in
 NE-to-NB transition. Many of the regulatory mechanisms involved in controlling NE
 cell fate are conserved between Drosophila and humans. Uncovering the molecular mechanisms
 through which Zld controls the NE-to-NB transition can lead to a better understanding
 of human neurodevelopmental diseases and brain tumors, as well as identifying targets

 architecture and sleep regulation, and how sleep can prevent or induce stress susceptibility.
 Combining EEG with transcriptomics of the medial prefrontal cortex, we found that
 mice susceptible to chronic social defeat (CSD) stress displayed fragmented NREM sleep
 with intrusions of wakefulness, which may be explained by differential expression
 of serotonergic receptors Htr1a/2a and afternoon blunting of Slc29a3 adenosine transport.
 Exposure to CSD increased the proportion of REM sleep at the beginning of the light
 cycle through more frequent but shorter bouts, which were associated with blunted
 morning expression of serotonergic signaling enzyme Prkcd and myelin function gene
 Mobp. Furthermore, manipulating sleep through TSD or REM deprivation (REMD) suggested
 that recovery sleep after REMD, but not TSD, may promote resilience to stress. Findings
 from this Capstone project therefore support the notion that susceptibility to stress
 and adaptive sleep responses mutually affect each other.",2019

 tool with which to identify and extract structural elements within documents. This
 is due to the fact that PDFs do not conform to any conventions in terms of document
 structure and that PDF generators tend to use different rules for assembling the documents.
 A solution that can allow users to retrieve structured information from a document
 in a form that is easily manipulated can have a noticeable positive impact for professionals
 across a broad spectrum of industries. The framework put forward in this paper, Texture,
 uses diverse heuristic techniques in order to extract structural elements (lists,
 titles, headers and footers, paragraphs, figures and tables) from PDFs. They are assigned
 different weights that lead to robust and accurate extractors. Texture also introduces
 a domain specific language that allows users to query documents using natural language.
 We demonstrate that Texture has potential to perform as well as the manual labeling
 process while being much easier to use than any labor crowdsourcing platform. Texture
 is also cheaper, quicker, and more scalable than hiring crowd workers to handle the
 same extraction tasks.",2018

 in different directions in the horizontal (xz) plane while their brain activity was
 measured. Using a new algorithm TAFKAP, the brain was modeled through uncertainty-based
 methods that could capture these correlations. While uncertainty-based decoding techniques
 have been used before, they have predominantly been applied to 2D orientation (rather
 than 3D motion). Neurons responsive to retinal orientation exist at an early stage
 of the visual hierarchy and as such are thought to be easier to decode, whereas 3D
 motion sensitive neurons are thought to exist later in the visual hierarchy and are
 therefore more difficult to decode. This project found that 3D motion could be successfully
 decoded from several ROIs (regions of interest like V1, V2, hMT, IPS) at an accuracy
 of greater than 50% (baseline chance at 12.5%).",2021

 George Boole's little understood work on probability and verify that its aim was indeed
 algebraization of finite probabilities. Boole had clearly understood the possibility
 of realizing his aim and had identified appropriate methods in terms of normal disjunctive
 form and algebraic relations. However, he had been unable to carry out algebraization
 due to inappropriate selection of events, which forced him to add improper conditions.
 In this study, we limit ourselves to the case of finitely many events to avoid the
 complications of countable additivity, which would not add much novelty and simply
 make the exposition more cumbersome. Moreover, we note that Boole had considered only

 One of the rising challenges in finance is that the complexity of financial instruments

 mathematical tools to address financial issues, such as the pricing of financial derivatives.
 The Black-Scholes option pricing model has become the firm basis for financial mathematics
 which finds adequate solutions to the pricing of a world-wide rapidly increasing number
 of derivatives. Many option pricing models have been developed since Black and Scholes
 published their work in 1973. In this paper, we study the original Black-Scholes option
 pricing model for European call options in terms of its derivation and applicability.
 By constructing a riskless portfolio taking positions in bonds (cash), option, and
 the underlying stock, we derive the Black-Scholes partial differential equations without
 and with dividends for European calls. With a series of changes of variables, we transform
 the Black-Scholes equation to the heat equation and obtain a closed-form solution

 study to hypothesize that negative charge on the surface of the T-cell gets attracted
 to the electromagnetic fields generated around the nodes of Ranvier and initiates
 the autoimmune response. By manipulating the electromagnetic forces of attraction
 between the cells, the MRI study showed that T-cell's mobility was impaired post-glucocorticoid
 receptor antagonization. The electrodynamic modeling determined the spatial and temporal
 progression of the electromagnetic field to quantify the nature of its interaction
 with the T-cell's surface charge and its role within the context of MS etiology. The
 potential implications of this research could lead to better understanding of the
 disease's symptoms and provide a framework to explain its uncertain times of onset.",2017

 a general impairment in WM storage because of attentional selection processes. We
 designed a continuous delayed estimation task in which we manipulated the frequency

 WM, to investigate how the process of selectively attending to items held in WM influences
 WM performance. Critically, we designed three retro-cue conditions in which we assess
 whether the retro-cue effect is present and whether selection has a cost on WM performance.

 in labor market outcomes and thoroughly documented in economic experiments. More recently,
 ""self-competition"" has been suggested as a strategy to increase gender parity. This
 study attempts to replicate the finding that self-competition eliminates the gender
 gap present in traditional competitive scenarios, recruiting the same sample and using
 nearly identical procedures as a previous study. The self-competition effect does
 not replicate: a weakly significant gender gap persists in self- competition and no
 evidence of a meaningful difference between other- and self-competition is observed.
 Risk attitudes predict competitive choices in all conditions, and the self-competition
 effect observed in the original study appears to be due to low score variance and
 learning effects reducing the riskiness of self-competing. The evidence suggests that
 policies for inequality reduction should aim to directly address gender differences
 in confidence and risk aversion rather than emphasize self-improvement.",2018

 of socio-economic well-being and the size of the budget allocated to a commune in
 the Parisian region, across time. Communes are the smallest French territorial divisions
 and since 1982, raise a substantial part of their budget on their own following a
 national policy on fiscal and administrative decentralization. The Ile-de-France region
 counts 1276 communes as of 2018 (INSEE) and offers the ideal set-up for a case study
 with the capital city Paris being at its center and it
 offering data on many observable economic variables. The central question driving
 this thesis is the extent to which the public budget collected by every municipality
 is affected by the standard of living of individuals in that very circumscription.
 I hypothesize that living standards should consistently predict, across
 time, budget size. If that hypothesis holds, the implication is that richer communes
 would get a higher budget per capita, therefore feeding into a cycle of positive cash
 recycling (i.e. more infrastructures and productive public goods). The poorer communes,
 where are located most of the banlieues and a large immigrant and second-
 generation immigrant population, would then see a widening inequality gap in terms
 of available funds and therefore opportunities for social mobility. The findings point
 towards the existence of a time lag between living standards and budgets as well as
 a two-way causal relation; I find that income levels and quality of education
 corroborate my main hypothesis. However, the data shows that the government is intervening
 to level up the budget inequalities through equalization schemes.",2019

 as intermediaries as they reproduce the good at zero cost and resell it to other buyers
 they have access to. Sellers indirectly appropriate profits from buyers along intermediation
 chains, but also enter into competition with buyers who replicate and resell. A network
 partition captures the effects of monopoly power versus competition. We extend the
 analysis to investigate the effects of limited resale opportunities on a seller's
 captive market and profits. By generating a directed network, we find that restricting
 resale expands sellers' captive markets when a network is sufficiently well-connected.
 Meanwhile, restricting resale limits diffusion and generates competition between buyers.
 As a result, a seller may be unable to extract profits from every buyer within his
 captive market, but he may obtain more than his bilateral monopoly share when the
 threat of dealing with the next highest-value buyer is credible. We find a formula
 to compute sellers' profits when there is no uncertainty in diffusion paths and competition

 impact on the electoral manifestation of Euroscepticism in the 2019 elections to the

 regional- and national-level data by capturing regional income inequality values within
 a country. Regional income disparity is measured by the standard deviation of Gross
 Regional Product per capita across each country. This metric is then introduced into
 the multivariate regression model featuring additional economic and political variables.
 The model supports the hypothesis that the magnitude of regional income disparities

 with a statistically insignificant result. The positive effect of regional income
 inequalities on Eurosceptic votes is especially pronounced in non-Eurozone countries.",2020

 little is known about consumer support for efforts aiding refugees, and even less

 and measure its effect on respondents' generosity, empathy and willingness to pay.
 I find that priming robustly and consistently increases respondents' levels of generosity
 and empathy. However, such effects do not extend to significant increases in consumer
 willingness to pay. Taken together, these findings suggest a clear disconnect between
 self-identification with generous and empathic attitudes and real willingness to monetarily
 support programs aiding Venezuelan refugees. As a pioneer in the field, this paper
 opens the discussion of consumer attitudes toward supporting this crisis and highlights
 the urgency to motivate an integrated approach to refugee aid by understanding consumer

 use significantly less fertilizer than MHH when rainfall is below the expected level
 of rainfall. For each additional child and consumption expenditure a FHH has, the
 household uses less fertilizer than MHH, and livestock does not modify FHH's fertilizer

 study analyzed and addressed some of the most common FI determinants in Ethiopia.
 Descriptive and econometric analysis methods were used to determine and evaluate the
 determinants of FI. Mainly the study focused on understanding the determinants of
 FI on socio-economic and demographic factors such as gender, education, financial
 literacy, financial capability, and FI barriers. The analysis found that better education,
 financial literacy, gender, living in urban or rural areas, living in the capital
 city, religion, and preference for formal financial services are associated with a
 significant level of FI. The majority of the citizens in Ethiopia cannot access financial
 services for both voluntary and involuntary reasons. Notably, distance from financial
 service institutions is a significant barrier to FI. The study suggests non-traditional
 financial services and products such as agent banking and mobile banking should be
 promoted and expanded in rural Ethiopia. Notably, most Ethiopians live in rural areas,
 and distance from financial service institutions is a significant barrier to FI. Therefore,
 the government should increase traditional banking and microfinance branches and promote

 reforms for this deterioration. Furthermore, there is a number of other, often less
 obvious changes in the state structure that redistributed power from the executive
 and judiciary branches to the Parliament and thus allowed uncontested governance for
 Fidesz. In this paper I intend to investigate the state of the Hungarian Separation

 formerly reserved to the other branches. This analysis may also have implications
 for other young and transitional democracies (anocracies) around the world.",2014

 The examination of how the Hungarian legal system shapes and constructs Roma identity
 reveals how national and ethnic identities are part of ""classificatory struggles""

 framework do not explicitly mention racial categories, they do set the Roma apart
 from the majority and only a minority of them can perform the identity that the state

 a country's wealth influences its likelihood of providing peacekeepers. I theorize
 that the UN's fixed monthly payment per soldier provides more incentive to developing
 countries to supply troops, than it does to developed countries. Therefore, I look
 at the relationship between a country's wealth, the interaction of wealth and military
 capacity, and the interaction of wealth and proximity to a conflict on the country's
 peacekeeping supply. I find that wealth in itself is a poor predictor for supplying
 peacekeepers. However, the interaction between wealth and military capacity is a good
 predictor: Poorer countries show an increase in troops supplied with an increased
 defense budget, while there is no effect for richer countries. Lastly, rich countries
 in unstable regions seem to be less willing to supply troops than rich countries in
 stable regions. I conclude that the UN's fixed monthly payment induces poorer countries
 to contribute more troops than their richer counterparts.",2014

 the regime type of a country affects different measures of its policies presented

 Contributions, namely policy type, unconditional and conditional emission reduction
 targets, and aggregate adaptation targets. My results reveal that policy type is largely
 unaffected by regime type. There is evidence that democracies in the high income quartiles
 have higher unconditional and conditional emission reduction targets than autocracies

 turn out to be a key driver, where less corrupt countries have lower aggregate adaptation
 policies. I infer that policy type reflects the Common But Differentiated Responsibilities
 principle of international law. Democracies, facing double audience costs, commit
 to higher tangible and monitorable targets, such as emission reduction targets. However,
 since aggregate adaptation policies do not lend themselves to clear monitorable mechanisms,
 they are used by more corrupt countries to compensate for expected international audience
 costs.",2018

 Secondly, we assess the amplification of national identification by looking at the

 leads to the fall in ethnic identification. The increased access to news from the

 engender different sexuality outcomes. Using a cross-classification variable comprised
 of sexual attraction, relationships and identity, this study examines the effects
 of individual-level and environmental-level indicators of school integration, religious
 fundamentalism, experience of prejudice, exposure to violence, and school sanctions.
 Using multinomial regression analysis of data from the National Longitudinal Survey

 fluidity and sexuality outcomes, particularly in female respondents, while there is
 also some indication that more supportive environments engender greater sexual diversity.
 Given the considerable psychological consequences of repressing one's sexuality, the
 findings of this study encourage policy interventions at the high-school level to
 foster greater education and inclusivity to overcome the additive stresses that sexual
 minority youth face, while encouraging further research into the dynamics of contemporary

 the primary mechanism for European representation and delegation. The EU party system
 functions at two levels: national and supranational. At the European elections, EU
 citizens vote for a national party of their choice. After the elections, the national
 parties that have received enough votes enter the EP and join one of the transnational
 European political groups (""EP factions""). These groups are conglomerates of different
 national parties and form coalitions based on – what they claim to be – a shared ideology.
 This study examines 1) whether the EP factions are programmatically cohesive, and
 2) whether programmatic cohesion, rather than intra-faction pressure, is what explains
 the high voting cohesion rates of EP factions. Discriminant analysis based on the
 programmatic profiles of national parties suggests that EP factions are programmatically
 cohesive units. Variation in the voting agreement rates, however, is mostly due to
 intra-faction pressure, more prominent in the mainstream pro-EU factions. The programmatic
 cohesion and voting efficacy of EP factions prove that EP elections and the legislative
 process are becoming increasingly European and decreasingly national.",2014

 rates in India in the last few decades are thought to reflect the success of the processes

 be occurring independent of social development. The purpose of this paper is to analyze
 the changing gender differential in child mortality (which is a reflection of either
 an intensification or a reduction in the effect of son preference), when there is
 a fall in fertility. This question is analyzed using two waves of NFHS data to build
 on the work of Basu (1999) and Gupta and Bhat (1997). I find that in states that were
 already characterized by a preference for sons, a fall in fertility at a relatively

 in others it is a context-specific resource for effective decision-making. Moreover,
 an expansion of social capital to extend beyond isolated ethnic communities is decisive
 for all subjects; either for its conversion into necessary cultural capital or through
 the avoidance of some of the negative effects of social capital on women in certain
 tightly-bound ethnic communities. While the mobilisation of ethnicity is useful for
 the upward mobility of a subgroup of German-Turkish women, it is a limitation for

 commenters concerned with the extremist discourse overshadowed those in support of

 from individuals becoming focused on nationalist stances on migration. The discursive
 deflection in this research is not unique to Facebook users in Germany. It emerged

 dokha through social settings in which a person who has brought dokha from the UAE

 for a number of reasons, the most compelling of which is the physiological effect,

 of second-generation immigrants has a positive effect on their socioeconomic outcomes.
 The study uses online cross-sectional survey responses from self-identified second-generation
 immigrants in the U.S. (n=3215). The linear regression analysis shows that bilingual
 second-generation immigrants have higher earnings relative to their English monolingual
 counterparts; children of Chinese immigrants outperform their second-generation peers;
 there is no effect of signaling bilingualism in the resume, and all levels of bilingualism
 improve occupational status. Thus, I conclude that investment in bilingualism for

 the following question: why did Finland adopt its National Action Plan for the United
 Nations Security Council Resolution on Women, Peace and Security in 2008? By looking
 into policy documents and speeches, as well as drawing from public debate and previous
 literature on foreign policy change and policy diffusion, I find that the Finnish
 case warrants a multi-layered explanation: using the policy diffusion mechanisms of
 learning, competition, coercion and emulation, the drive for Finnish foreign policy
 change has taken place on three distinct levels (international, regional, and civil
 society), where the three levels mutually created the condition for change.",2019

 studying the experiences of Bosnian refugee families resettled to Boise, Idaho, USA
 during and immediately after the Bosnian War (1992-1995). Focusing on transnational
 practices developed by refugees over two decades in the United States, my analysis
 questions the prevailing image of refugees as inherently political transnational actors.
 This study investigates non-political forms of refugee transnationalism by examining
 patterns of ownership and flows of goods, funds, and people between Boise and Bosnia.

 the UAE offers a quasi-experimental insight into the two different pools of entrepreneurs
 that result by having a 'high' or 'low' bar—the former for residents and the latter
 for nationals. In comparing the experiences of entrepreneurs emerging across these
 two pools, this capstone asks whether a more 'helpful' legal and institutional environment

 that the increased ease of starting up is not necessarily an advantage, this study

 themselves. The experiences of half Emiratis in the UAE interacts in ambivalent ways;
 on the one hand, they are stigmatized and discriminated against by the national population
 because of their perceived impure race and low-status class but also because of a
 restrictive collective notion of national identity that is mandated by the state.
 Though some half Emiratis signal their Emiratiness to avoid this stigma, it is impossible
 for some half Emiratis to disguise their foreign identity because of racial and cultural
 differences such as phenotypical differences, dialect, sexual orientation and other
 lifestyle practices. This stigma resulted in half Emirati's negative prospects on
 marriage and their choice in masking either their Emirati or non-Emirati identity.
 On the other hand, half Emiratis' identities are privileged in the context of the
 workplace because of their perceived linguistic capital but also their positive reputation
 among the expat community which enables them to project their non-Emirati identity
 more to disassociate themselves from the 'lazy' Emirati stereotype.",2021

 Due to the UAE being a patriarchal society with strict cultural values for females,
 there is a tendency to overlook female drug abusers. Despite the gender context, Emirati
 females constitute a large proportion of addiction patients. However, the results
 of this study go beyond this demographic to analyze broader issues within people's
 perceptions of drug use and treatment. While most research on drug abuse in the UAE
 has adopted a medical perspective, my capstone examines the role of family and gender
 norms in producing stigma. This study explores the different perceptions of drug use
 in the UAE by analyzing 14 interviews with medical professionals, 385 online surveys
 collected from the general public, and 7 online surveys collected from former female
 patients. The findings illustrate that both medical professionals and Emiratis agree
 that drug use is taboo in the UAE. The family was found to be the prominent factor
 in my study, as all three populations perceived the family as causing or preventing
 drug use among Emiratis. This study also looks at challenges of awareness and treatment;

 the family dimension. To equalise understanding, youth ""diffuse'' mental health knowledge
 to their parents, a process which takes place as part of ""emotional negotiation"".
 Youth motivation to partake in this process include the desire for familial acceptance,
 extrinsic pressures from an imbalanced care economy, and intrinsic aspirations to
 normalise mental health and their experiences. This study fills a lacuna on scholarship
 pertaining to the mental health experiences of families and help-seeking behaviour.
 It reveals that young people who choose to seek help are tasked with relaying these
 learnings back to their parents and normalising their experience. Subsequently, these

 gentrification in low-income urban neighborhoods from 1990 to 2010. Using propensity

 college-educated residents, whose heightened presence could be conducive to a proliferation
 of neighborhood amenities and an increased likelihood of low-income residents attending

 low-income neighborhoods from within into spaces of opportunity. Nevertheless, the
 paper considers the classed and racialized nature of gentrification that governs low-income
 residents' access to opportunity in their revitalized neighborhoods. Framing LIHTC-funded

 power strategy. The UAE is the first Middle Eastern country to host the World Expo
 in 2020. Soft power plays a vital role in its ability for countries to obtain the
 outcomes they desire through attraction. We hope to discover how this mega-event can

 humanitarian, scientific and academic, national representatives, people, culture and
 media, and economic. Our study is based on surveys conducted on-site at Expo 2020
 for 135 country pavilion representatives. The survey measured the respondents' current
 and future perception of Expo 2020 and its effectiveness at implementing the goals
 put forward by the UAE's Soft Power Council. An ethnography was also administered
 to supplement the insights on the given environment at Expo 2020.",2022
